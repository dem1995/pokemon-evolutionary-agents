# Pokémon Evolutionary Agents
Project by [Dawn McKnight](https://github.com/dem1995) and [Zeyi Wang](https://github.com/uduse) in Winter 2020 for the CMPUT 659: Explainable AI course at the University of Alberta.
## Summary
Artifical intelligences can be tailored for a variety of means, including performance, or how strong agents are; and explainability, or how human-comprehensible the resulting agents are. In this project, we explore the usage of an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a domain-specific language for the purpose of finding explainable, relatively strong artificial intelligence for the popular video game series <em>Pokémon</em>.
